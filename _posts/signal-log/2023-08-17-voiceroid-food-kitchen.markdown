sick again (try to guess with what) so I'm doing the only thing that matters right now with a low-grade fever: watching voiceroid kitchen videos

it has been maybe a good decade since I last had grilled corn on a farm in unincorporated virginia. I had to keep asking my dad for extra dollars because I had probably four or five cobs that day, back when such things were still one buck. what I'm still trying to figure out is why we call posting good food 夜食テロ (fourth meal terrorism) when people are able to post videos [like this](https://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm41808768) without getting locked up. these guys are instead making affiliate revenue by linking to butter on amazon. that butter should be slathered on corn, not inside a chocolate bar sandwich!
